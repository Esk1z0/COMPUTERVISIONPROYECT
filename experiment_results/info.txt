The following explains the organization of this folder

[Basic example for the ffNN Challenge]
The Basic/ folder is the one with the results of executing the base example given by the teachers.
    this folder contains the model weights with a folder format instead of a *.keras file format
    except for the Basic/ folder/experiment all the other are saved in a *.keras file format
    if we load this folder we would get the weights of the model trained with that basic example notebook

[ffNN Challenge]
The folders starting with a number are the ones corresponding to the ffNN challenge experiments
    all these folders have the following structure:
        [number]_[experiment_name]:
            model_checkpoints/
            model.keras
    the model_checkpoints/ folder contains all the checkpoints made during the training.
    the model.keras file has the weights of the model trained in it's corresponding notebook

[CNN Challenge]
From now on the experimentation folders will follow this structure:
    CNN_[number]_[experiment_name]:
        model_checkpoints/
        results/
            metrics_by_class.csv
            metrics_global.csv
        model.keras
    Where model_checkpoints/ is as in the ffNN Challenge
    Where results/ contains .csv with the metrics of the model
    Where model.keras is a .keras file with the best model obtained during the training, not just the weights

The model_checkpoints/ folders will mostly be empty as they occupy so much space
